I am a second year PhD researcher in the [School of Civil Engineering](https://engineering.leeds.ac.uk/civil) at the University of Leeds. I studied in Leeds at undergraduate level also, and graduated with an MEng in Civil & Structural Engineering 2017. My PhD research is focused around improving the river network representation in global flood models. I recently published a paper [validating 6 global flood models in Nigeria and Mozambique](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aae014). My current work is focused on population exposure to rivers of different sizes and how this can help determin the appropriate scale representation of global flood models.
